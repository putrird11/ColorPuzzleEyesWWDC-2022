# WWDC22 Scholarship Submission - ColorPuzzleEyes [ACCEPTED]

Color Puzzle for Eyes is a puzzle game that is played by arranging several squares into the shape of an image according to a predetermined color. With the aim that users can distinguish well several types of colors that are almost similar.
I have a friend named "Arkan" who really wants to become a soldier, he continues to prepare physically so that he can qualify to become a soldier. Running, push ups, swimming. But he didn't realize earlier that he was indicated to be color blind. Though color blindness is the initial test that must be done. In the end he failed the initial test and he regretted not knowing it earlier. From this game, I want to know in advance if he has problems with eye acuity in seeing colors.
